# [ROS](www.ros.org) (Robot Operating System)

This is a place where we at Qualisys gather resources for [ROS](www.ros.org) (Robot Operating System).

There are quite a few people doing work with Qualisys motion capture systems and ROS and some of them share their work so we compile them here to help customers with their ROS work.
